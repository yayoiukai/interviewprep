interviewprep
=============

This is my humble effort to try to get better at coding interview in Python. 
I followed coursera's princeton algorithm part1 and I implemented most of their algorithm in Python. I also solved in python the questions from crackingCodingInterview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. Also there is some other random code that I think it would be useful.
